# Obsidian_Pentest_Template
This is just a repository of everything needed to drop into obisidian for a clean and nice Pentest Template

While beginning my studies for OSCP, I found tons of people referrencing TJ Null and all the work that he has put in to provide such useful information to the community. In TJ Null's blog post on [NetSec Focus](https://www.netsecfocus.com/oscp/2021/05/06/The_Journey_to_Try_Harder-_TJnull-s_Preparation_Guide_for_PEN-200_PWK_OSCP_2.0.html), he references [his own](https://github.com/tjnull/TJ-JPT/tree/master) template in [Joplin](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin), which he has really liked for himself, and a few other notetaking platforms. One of which is [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), I persoanlly have really enjoyed Obsidian. There were no templates mentioned that were already in Markdown format, so I took TJ Nulls template from Joplin and exported it in Markdown format so that I could use it in Obsidian. And it worked out quite well. So here is a Markdown style/format of TJ Nulls Pentest Template thats ready to use right out the gate, or have some configurations of your own made to it! Enjoy!
